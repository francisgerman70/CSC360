These four programs carry out different tasks, all program read the IMA file. Diskinfo displays information about the system (Operating system, label, free size of disk, number of root files, number of FAT copies, and sectors per FAT), disklist displays the contents of the root directory and all sub-directories (possibly multi-layers) in the file system, diskget copies a file from the root directory of the file system to the current directory in Linux and disk get copies a file from the current Linux directory into specified directory (i.e., the root directory or a subdirectory) of the file system.

How to use programs:
Step 1: execute "make" in terminal to compile all four programs
Step 2: execute "././diskinfo disk.IMA","./disklist disk.IMA", "./diskget disk.IMA inputfile","./diskput disk.IMA inputfile" with input file in terminal to run
